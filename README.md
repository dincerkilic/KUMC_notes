**sudo apt-get update**:upgrade command downloads and installs the updates for each outdated package and dependency on your system.

**sudo apt-get install xxx**:command is used to download the latest version of your desired application from an online software repository pointed to by your sources.

**tmux**: allows you to create several "pseudo terminals" from a single terminal.

**Ctrl D**: kill the session.

**tmux ls**: list the running sessions.

0: 1 windows (created Sat Aug 27 20:54:58 2022)

**tmux attach -t 0**: attach session

**Ctrl B D**: detach sesssion

At the bottom part of tmux window: [0]: this is the session name. By default, theyâ€™re numbered, starting with zero. 0:bash*: the 0 indicates this is the first window in this session.

Log in to server: **ssh tenor.ifx.kumc.edu**

**Setting Up Public Key Authentication for SSH**

The following simple steps are required to set up public key authentication (for SSH):

1.Key pair is created (typically by the user). This is typically done with ssh-keygen.

2.Private key stays with the user (and only there), while the public key is sent to the server. Typically with the ssh-copy-id utility.

3.Server stores the public key (and "marks" it as authorized).

4.Server will now allow access to anyone who can prove they have the corresponding private key.

SSH keys should be generated on the computer you wish to log in from. This is usually your local machine.

**ssh-keygen**: an SSH key is used to access a remote server through an SSH connection. The keys come in pairs, a public key and a private key. The public key is kept within the server and the private key is with the user or the client.

You may be prompted to set a password on the key files themselves, but this is a fairly uncommon practice, and you should press enter through the prompts to accept the defaults. Your keys will be created at ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub and ~/.ssh/id_rsa

A public key that is copied to the SSH server(s). 

A private key that remains (only) with the user.

**id_rsa** private key
**id_rsa.pub** public key

Send the public key to the remote server:
**ssh-copy-id user@server-ip**
Then,

**ssh remote_username@remote_host**

**git-fat**: a tool for managing large binary files in git repositories.

**git fat init**: initialize the repository. 

**git fat push**: remember to push it to the fat store.

**git fat pull**

**git clone xx.git**: clone the repository.

**git add file_name**: to let git to track file.

**git commmit -m "message"**: save changes.

**git push origin master**: upload files to github. To be able to do that you need to make github to recognize your machine. Create ssh key. Add it to github (github.com > settings > SHH and GPG keys). master is branch that we want to push to.

**git init**: to initialize on local the git, then continue with add, and commit. Create a repository on github. Then **git remote add origin xx.git**. Then pudh.
