**ssh-keygen**: an SSH key is used to access a remote server through an SSH connection. The keys come in pairs, a public key and a private key. The public key is kept within the server and the private key is with the user or the client.

A public key that is copied to the SSH server(s). 

A private key that remains (only) with the user.

**Setting Up Public Key Authentication for SSH**

The following simple steps are required to set up public key authentication (for SSH):

1.Key pair is created (typically by the user). This is typically done with ssh-keygen.

2.Private key stays with the user (and only there), while the public key is sent to the server. Typically with the ssh-copy-id utility.

3.Server stores the public key (and "marks" it as authorized).

4.Server will now allow access to anyone who can prove they have the corresponding private key.
